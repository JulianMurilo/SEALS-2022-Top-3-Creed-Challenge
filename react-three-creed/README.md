This Website's Purpose was to serve as a challenge in order to figure out how to transfer regular HTML and other web-site elements into a react-app environment.

Originally, the code that was transferred over into React was meant to explain which of the leadership creeds was the most important to myself. This was done through creating HTML elements, which helped to bring information and content to my website. We then started to working on the CSS function, and how to import it through the header element in HTML. In CSS, we learned about Classes, Id's, Animations, and other customization css elements that could be put onto text in order to make it look better. We also learned about how CSS is cascading, and is read by the website from top to bottom. Finally, we worked on implementing the javascript part, which was supposed to add more functionality to our websites than before. We added two button that were supposed to stop and start the animations.

The Process of moving it to React, started with these steps: using the windows terminal to cd into my SEALS folder. Then using npx create-react-app [name of app] in order to start creating a template. Then moving the finished folder onto VS code in order to work on it. I used a HTML to JSX translator in order to turn all my HTML tags into a readable syntax for my website. I then started to move my CSS and JS into their respective folders, and started to import them all together.
