      In truth, no person has an absolute hold on all of the leadership creeds,
      which is why it is important that you at least have this one. Learning and
      improvement derives from the ability to reflect on ones self (mentally and
      physically), it is only when we do this when we can strive to use agency
      in order to achieve goals/new heights that we were previously unable to
      obtain before. It is through this goal that we can be able to work towards
      achieving many of these other creeds, where even if you take to heart some
      of the others, and not this one, you will be unable to gain or even
      maintain any of your other creeds. I try to understand myself better by
      reflecting on myself at the end of the day, where my day has become quiet
      and I am able to finally hear my own thoughts. Often times I ponder on the
      negative aspects of my days where things could of gone way better than
      they should have. After pondering, I go to sleep in order to regain my
      strength. In the morning, I wake up more rejuvenated than ever, and
      motivated to not fall into the same negative habits as before that caused
      me to ponder at night.{" "}

      "I believe nothing is hard, just a lot of work"
    </li>
    <p1 className="paragraphtext">
      During our time in SCLA, we were first introduced to this creed, and had
      to implement it first-hand when making our MVP's for product day. Yet,
      even after product day, I have started to take it to heart since I
      understood how the hardest tasks/subjects are broken down into achievable
      parts. Everything starts to become more formulaic, and you start to
      appreciate and understand the progress you have gained while completing
      harder and harder task. For example: Its been over a year since I have
      been doing Jujitsu, where in the first initial months, my technique was
      lacking and I was using too much strength and managing my stamina
      incorrectly. Through many more Jujitsu classes, along with researching the
      Ruotolo Brothers, who have similar characteristics in fighting to me, I
      have started to spar with increasing amount of take-downs and escapes,
      where eventually I am able to understand the different opening that my
      opponent gives me in order to submit them.{" "}

    <li className="listtext">
      "I believe in helping my neightbor and community"
    </li>
    <p1 className="paragraphtext">
      I believe that every person at one point in their lives should be able to
      give something back to the community they grew up in. Since its important
      to give something meaningful to the city, community, and people who you
      have known since childhood. Creating products and MVP's is just one of the
      many ways to help both your neighbor and community, since often times,
      these products are created to serve a greater purpose/problem. For myself,
      I always volunteer at my local church's food drive, where we organize
      piles of cans of food for those who need it, along with giving out free
      gift certificates. Another way I try to help my community, is through my
      schools eSports program, where we try to center our goals and vision
      around a diverse and open gaming experience, where every school kid will
      be able to have the the opportunity to achieve scholarships/competitive
      gaming skills that they can take with them past highschool.
